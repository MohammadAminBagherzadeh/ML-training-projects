# ML Training Projects
This repository contains a curated set of machine learning projects I have completed as part of my learning journey in data science and machine learning. Each project focuses on applying core ML algorithms to real or sample datasets, illustrating my understanding of fundamental concepts, practical implementation skills, and Python programming ability.

These training projects form the foundation of my machine learning portfolio and demonstrate my readiness to pursue more advanced studies or professional roles in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

# Objective

The goals of this repository are to:
Demonstrate practical machine learning skills through hands-on implementations
Apply supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to real data
Show proficiency with essential ML libraries and workflows
Support my academic applications and professional portfolio
The projects range from regression and classification to clustering and recommendation systems.

# Project Structure

The repository is organized into individual project folders or notebooks. Each folder contains a focused machine learning task, including:

**Regression**

Simple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Non-Linear Regression
Tehran House Prices (Regression example using real data gathered from Tehran city in Iran)

These projects cover numerical prediction tasks and help build intuition for continuous target modeling.

**Classification**

Logistic Regression
SVM Classification
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Decision Trees Classification
Risk of Heart Attack (Binary Classification example using real life data)

Classification projects show understanding of binary and multiclass decision boundaries.

**Clustering**

K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
DBSCAN Clustering
Customer Clustering (Using real life data found on Kaggle)

These demonstrate unsupervised learning for grouping similar data.

**Recommendation Systems**

User-Similarity Recommendation (Trained on Netflix's data)
Content-Based Recommendation (Trained on Netflix's data)
Phone Recommender System (Using real life data found on Kaggle)

These projects explore approaches for suggesting items based on data patterns.

# What I Have Learned

Across the projects in this repository, I worked with:
Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
Supervised learning: regression and classification models
Unsupervised learning: clustering and segmentation
Model evaluation and performance metrics
Python ML libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy
These skills are essential in real-world machine learning workflows and academic research.

# How to Explore the Projects

To explore or run the projects:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MohammadAminBagherzadeh/ML-training-projects.git

Navigate into a project folder

Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) in your preferred environment (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter Lab, or Google Colab)

Run the cells to view data analysis, models, and results

No advanced environment setup is required beyond Python and common ML libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas).

# Notes for Reviewers

These are training projects, not production-grade systems — they demonstrate core understanding and practice.
Many projects include sample data or Kaggle datasets to explore real patterns and model behaviors.
This collection reflects my progression as a machine learning practitioner and forms the base for more advanced future work.
